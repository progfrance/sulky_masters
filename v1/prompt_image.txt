The track is divided into a grid of 48 clear rectangular spaces marked by white lines. Key gameplay feature: In the two curved sections of the oval, the track splits into two parallel lanes (an interior short lane and an exterior passing lane), while the straight sections are single wide lanes. The center of the oval is manicured green turf with a subtle start line marking. Surrounded by white safety rails.
